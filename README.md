## AlgoArb
A project to highlight arbitrage opportunities on decentralised exchanges (DEXes) built on the [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com) network.

Also a chance for me to get some experience interacting with blockchain technologies.

As of now, [tinyman](https://tinyman.org) is the only DEX on Algorand, so currently I just compare ALGO and YLDY to their USD price, obtained from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com).

### Requirements
* https://github.com/tinymanorg/tinyman-py-sdk
* https://github.com/Algofiorg/algofi-amm-py-sdk

```
algoArb $ python3 arb.py YLDY ALGO
```
